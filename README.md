## How Covid 19 lockdowns changed my family's behaviour

This is a some data anlaysis and research I did to compare the stories I was hearing from all my family around the world of covid and covid lockdowns, to how people's actual movement was changing. 

I have plotted [Google's Movement data](https://github.com/fionasilke/covid_global_mobility/blob/master/google_presentation.ipynb) in all the countries where I have family, and compared covid case and death numbers, and stories I heard from my family, supported by a little research. I had fun trialling out plotting and improving my use of loops, as well as establishing a structure for all my projects. 

Countries included:

- Australia: Sydney, Melbourne, Townsville
- France: Loiret, Indre et Loire, Rhone du Bouches
- United States: Washington State
- Germany: North Rhine-Westphalia
- Japan: Tokyo
- Brazil: Sao Paulo
